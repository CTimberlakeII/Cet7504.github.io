   While learning about logic and conditional statements I couldnt help but realize how we use/see them in action. 
	 
Every day we are forced to make decisions from the most basic to the most complex. Even as a baby you were making 
	
your own decisions, however with each decision came the consequeces either good or bad. If you were hungry you 

would cry or/else you were full you would stop eating and be satisfied. As you can see you were making decisions every 

moment since the beginning.

     When students land on the lesson for Logic and Conditional Statements, try to use everyday logic to help you solve
		 
and understand what is being asked. A cool way to look at it is to use your common sense to also help you understand

what is going on and to solve the problem or to just make the program work. When coding it can get a little confusing,

actually who am I kidding to a beginner its very confusing , but after understanding and using my own logic of what

statement is "True or False" and how to code them properly, the process became A LOT easier to understand. When you

look at your code, think about who is reading it. You want your code to make sense to even a novice coder. Thats why I

say when you start writing your code use your own common sense and your everyday logic not just to solve logic and

conditional statements but all of your code. Lastly, which shoud actually be the first thing is to understand "control flow".

Control Flow helps tell our code whats next to be executed and this will help move along your code especially when

learning logic and conditional statements. Good Luck!!
