   I'm not going to lie learning code has been a difficult venture for me. It is steadily teaching me problem solving and 

definitley patience! As a beginner I can not stress enough to google, goolgle, and google all of your questions to help you 

fix and/or correct your code. Although Flatiron has given me the tools to be successful and somewhat easy to follow 

curriculum, I still find myself digging through countless youtube videos (Flatiron's Learn.co Channel) and many hours 

scrolling websites (https://ruby-doc.org/) and reading books.



   This may sound like someone who is upset or frustrated but that is definitley far from the case. Learning code has 
	 
opened my mind and has helped me develop my skills for the outside world. When I come across a situation that needs a

quick fix, subconsciously follow the rules for fixing code haha. First you gotta assess the situation and see where it can

be corrected. Secondly, try to implement different tactics to see what works and what does not. Lastly, come to the 

conclusion after "debugging" the problem! As you can see we all do this at some point throught the day subconciously.


   Like I said, coding can be rough but one thing for sure, it can definitley help you in the real world without you even 
	 
knowing it!
