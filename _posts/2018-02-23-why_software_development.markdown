Growing up I surely did not want to be what my friends considered as a NERD, so why would I ever think about becoming a software developer? There are litterally thousands of career paths anybody can decide to stroll down and for me as a optimistic little boy, I was going to play in the NBA. There was no way I was going to consider being in a cubicle punching keys dreadding what my life has become. So I thought....

The year was 2003 and my 11th birthday finally came along and all I wanted was toys, videogames, and definitely money. My dad handed me my first gift and before any breathing or talking all the wrapping paper was off and in my hands was a brand new iBook G3 laptop and not knowing what I had... I began to act like a spoiled brat. After a couple of weeks messing around with my toys and other gifts, I remember finally opening up and booting this wonderful machine. As soon as the OS loaded I was amazed. Even though as simple as it looked it was fascinating to see how different programs worked!

As the years progressed I found myself always submerged in new tech. At school, I started my own repair business taking broken bricked laptops to broken Xbox's and finding success and enjoyment while working on them. During my junior year of high school, I was able to sit in on a free seminar about programming and why and what it has done for our society today and what it can do for the future. I felt like the only person in the room and that the man was talking directly to me. As corny as it may sound, software develepment chose me and forever grateful for Flatiron school to help guide me to becoming professional software developer!!!
